\section{Mobile application for data gathering and model testing}

The application was written for Android devices supporting Android 8.1 or newer. As of 2024*, more than 93\% of Android devices should be compatible. The Android platform was chosen, as it was easier to test on and find a study group of the Android users as opposed to the iOS users (according to * , significantly more people in Poland, where the researchers are based in, use Android devices).

Technology used in the mobile application itself was Jetpack Compose, which is quoted by Google to be "Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI" (from site*). Language used was Kotlin. Persisence was achieved by using Android Room, which provided an abstraction layer over SQLite database, which was used for data collection.

TODO for KM: add statistics sources (Internet), some technicals about the inner workings of the app. How the data is stored, what is gathered and when. If you have any doubts, feel free to ask about any methods/composables. I will be updating method descriptions/docs soon -- JG
