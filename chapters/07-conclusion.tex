In conclusion, the approach used in this project and study needs to be further studied to be effectively evaluated. The effects of such an approach seem promising, but are currently behind the state of the art models. A larger study would also be a source of validation or rebutal to many hypotheses posed in the discussion chapter about the possible sources of error in model's performance on some specific users. Larger dataset, especially, if the users would agree to releasing it under an open source licence, could also benefit the scientific community at large.

It is important to note, that for many users, the model performed well. Further refinement or combining the model with other neural network types, further feature engineering or modification to data gathering process could also yield good results.

The research team thinks of the project as successful in demonstrating, that the approach taken is not without its merits, and can be further studied.
