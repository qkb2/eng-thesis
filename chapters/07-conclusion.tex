In summary, the approach used in this project and study needs to be further studied to be effectively evaluated. The effects of such an approach seem promising, but are currently behind the state-of-the-art models. A larger study would also be a source of validation or rebutal to many hypotheses posed in the discussion chapter about the possible sources of error in model's performance on some specific users. Larger dataset specifically could also benefit the scientific community at large, if the users would agree to releasing it under an open source licence.

It is worth highlighting that for many users, the model performed well. Further refinement or combining the model with other neural network types, feature engineering or modification to data gathering process could also lead to improved results.

The research team considers the project successful in demonstrating that the proposed approach has merit and warrants further exploration.
