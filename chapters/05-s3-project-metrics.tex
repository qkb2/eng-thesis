\subsection{Training and fine tuning}


\subsection{Data division}
During training, the models were evaluated using 5-fold cross validation.
For testing purposes, users were asked to provide an extra 100 character text. 



TODO for IW: write about the fine-tuning process, the metrics used and why are they used, cross-validations used etc. You can also post some hyperparam statistics here.
