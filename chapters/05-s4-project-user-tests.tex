\section{Testing model on users}

TODO for xxx: when the tests are done (hopefully a week) we will discuss this. Also, there could be a part about many-users recognition.

\subsection{Cross-smartphone user validation}
TODO: what happens if two users train on smartphones that are not their own? What happens, if they cross-use their original model on another phone?

\subsection{Discussion}
TODO: discuss the findings.
