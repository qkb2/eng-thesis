  abstract = {Personal keystroke modes are difficult to imitate and can therefore be used for identity authentication. The keystroke habits of a person can be learned according to the keystroke data generated when the person inputs free text. Detecting a user's keystroke habits as the user enters text can continuously verify the user's identity without affecting user input. The method proposed in this paper authenticates users via their keystrokes when they type free text. The user keystroke data is divided into a fixed-length keystroke sequence, which is then converted into a keystroke vector sequence according to the time feature of the keystroke. A model that combines a convolutional neural network and a recursive neural network is used to learn a sequence of individual keystroke vectors to obtain individual keystroke features for identity authentication. The model is tested using two open datasets, and the best false rejection rate (FRR) is found to be (2.07%,6.61%), the best false acceptance rate (FAR) is found to be (3.26%, 5.31%), and the best equal error rate (EER) is found to be (2.67%, 5.97%).}
